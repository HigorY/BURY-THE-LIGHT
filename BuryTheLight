A mood of temptation takes over my mind
Condemned
Fallen weak on my knees, summon the strength
Of mayhem
I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking
Black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames, I have been blessed, my family crest is a demon of death
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ashes are divine
Descent in misery
Destiny chasing time
Inherit the nightmare, surrounded by fate
Can't run away
Keep walking the line, between thе light
Led astray
Through vacant halls I won't surrender
Thе truth revealed in nights of ember
We fight through fire and ice forever
Two souls once lost and now they remember
I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking
Black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames, I have been blessed, my family crest is a demon of death
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ashes are divine
Descent in misery
Destiny chasing time
Disappear into the night
Lost shadows left behind
Obsessions pulling me
Feeling I've got to take what's mine
Beneath the shadows under veil of night
Constellations of blood pirouette, dancing through the grace of those who stand at my feet
Dreams of the black throne I keep on repeat
A derelict dark song from the ashes, the puppetmaster congregates all the masses
Pulling strings, twisting minds as blades hit
You want this power, then come try and take it
We are
The tree
Fire burns
Secret life
Bloodline yearns
Dark minds
Embrace
[?]
Bury the light deep within
Cast aside, there's no coming home
We're burning chaos in the wind
Drifting in the ocean all alone
